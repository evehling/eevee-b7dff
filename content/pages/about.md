    content: "I’m a Master’s student at USC studying computer science! I graduated with my dual bachelor's degrees in Cognitive Science and Informatics from USC in 2021. I love everything about development–the process of learning new languages & technologies, collaborating with others, and making an impact with the things I create. Over the past few years, I’ve had some amazing opportunities to intern at\_[IBM](https://www.ibm.com/products/aspera)\_and\_[Automation Anywhere](https://www.automationanywhere.com/company/about-us)\_and am actively looking for full-time development roles for 2022!\n\nIn my free time I enjoy nerding out about Star Wars, hanging out with the amazing kids of\_[USC Troy Camp](http://www.troycamp.org/), painting and coding, and playing volleyball.  Feel free to contact me on this site or add me on LinkedIn.\n"
